To do list:

1) display a stacked histogram showing number of calls at each VAF level
called by our list and the user's list. (If they include vafs, use those,
if they don't, then just show breakdown by 'true vafs' from deep validation

2) Add download links for the tables.

3) Clean up helper functions, drop in separate file. For now, stored in server file,
which prevents having to restart the server every time I make a change to that file. 
This happens automatically for the server and ui files.
