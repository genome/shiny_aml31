This is an [R Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) application that compares a user's variant list to 
calls derived from ultra-deep whole-genome and validation data generated from the AML31 tumor.

Descriptions of how the 'gold' and 'platinum' lists were generated can be found in this publication:
(insert publication info here).

Sequence data for those who wish to make their own variant calls is available through dbGaP (insert accession numbers here)
